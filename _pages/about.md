About me
======
My name is Jason Koylass. I am a junior at the University of Maryland Baltimore County who is studying Geography and Enviroenmental Systems. I grew up Guyana with my family and enjoyed being exposed to different cultures. Some of my hobbies include playing table tennis, video games, and spending time outdoors in nature. I am always open to learning new things, and I hope to continue my education by doing my Master's in some type of Natural Resoure Management.
