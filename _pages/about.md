About me
======
My name is Jason Koylass. I am a junior at the University of Maryland Baltimore County who is studying Geography and Enviroenmental Systems. I grew up in Guyana with my family and enjoyed being exposed to different cultures. Some of my hobbies include playing table tennis, video games, and spending time outdoors in nature. I am always open to learning new things, and I hope to continue my education by doing my Master's in some type of Natural Resoure Management. 

Brief Education
======
B.S. Geography and Environmental Systems (May 2025)

Final Project
======
This project will focus on water quality (specifically phosphate/nitrogen levels) data sets within the 4 counties with the highest levels of Phosphate Mining Activity in Florida. I am looking at the relationship of these values to the median household income among tracts. The main mining areas are located in Polk, Hillsborough, Manatee, and Hardee counties, with one mine in North Florida's Hamilton County.
